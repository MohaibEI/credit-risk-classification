## Credit Risk Analysis Report

# Purpose of Analysis

We analyzed data to build a smart tool that predicts if people wanting loans are likely to pay them back. This helps peer-to-peer lending services make good decisions about who to lend money to & if they're a good candidate.

# Accuracy Scores:

- Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.20%
  - This means our model is right about 95.2% of the time when considering both catching the right people who will pay back (sensitivity) and identifying those who won't (specificity).

- Precision Score: 92%
  - This means that 92% of the predicted positives from our model seem to be correct

- Recall Score: 95%
  - This means that our model is 95% precise, indicating that 95% of its positive predictions accurately corresponded to true positive values.

# Summary 

I suggest using this tool to predict if borrowers will pay back their loans because it's fairly accurate (over 95%). This accuracy is essential for the lending company to understand the risk and ensure they have enough money flowing in to stay in business and make a profit. In the lending industry, there are a lot of high-risk potential customer so for a lender, it's a reliable way to make smart decisions about who to lend money to.
